# Business Analyst Project
## Problem Statment

### 1. Walmart Sales Analysis:
- A. Analyze the performance of sales and revenue at the city and branch level 
- B. What is the average price of an item sold at each branch of the city 
- C. Analyze the performance of sales and revenue, Month over Month across the
Product line, Gender, and Payment Method, and identify the focus areas to
get better sales for April 2019. 
<br>

### 2. App Exploration: 
Explore the features and user experience of the Jar app. Identify two aspects that
you think could be significantly improved and explain your reasoning behind each
suggestion.<br>

### 3. Product Optimisation: 
The Jar app has an engagement feature called 'Spin to Win'.
Right now, if 100 people come to the app each day, only 23 of them try out this
spinning game. But, we know that people who spin are more likely to retain on the
app and do transactions.
Now, we want to get more people to play the game. So, the question is, how can we
make sure that at least 50 people out of every 100 who visit the app each day will
play 'Spin to Win'? What can we do to get more people interested in spinning the
wheel?
